# dotbashrc
This is my .bashrc repo that works under both OSX and linux and allow to have specific/
private customizations.

## Installation
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/JeffMerlet/dotbashrc.git
```

Make a backup of your existing dot bash files.  
Then, move all the dot* files under your root and rename and replace `dot` with `.` for each of the file.
Add your own customization in `.bashrc-custom`.
